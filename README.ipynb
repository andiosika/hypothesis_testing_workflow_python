    "### The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we worked with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company. Here's the schema for the Northwind database:\n",

    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-3-project/master/Northwind_ERD_updated.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to test abilities to gather information from a real-world database and use knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be of value to the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to query the database and get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis and provide insight / suggestions to the business.  In this statistical analysis, perform hypothesis testing with both **null and alternative hypothesis** $H_0$ and $H_1$ respectively.\n",

    "Contains SQL code to extract required data, visualizations, hypothesis testing, findings and recommendations for each of the following four questions and hypotheses:\n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "1) Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$H_0$:There is no statistcally significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order in relation to a discount amount.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$H_1$:Discounts have a statistically significant effect on the quantiy of a product in an order.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$H_1a$:Certain discount values have a greater effect than others.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2) Do some categories generate more money than others ?? Which ones?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$ùêª_0$ : All categories generate equal revenues.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$ùêª_1$ : Certain categories sell at statistically higher rates of revneu than others.\n",

    "3) Do certain sales representatives sell more than others? Who are the top sellers?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$H_0$: All sales representatives generate equal revenue.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$H_1$: Some sales representatives generate more than others in revenue.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4) Where are our customers from that spend the most money?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$ùêª_0$ : Customers spend equal amounts regardless of region.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$ùêª_1$ : Region has an effect on total amount spent.\n",
